I cannot really determine whether it has tightening properties or not because my skin hasn’t reached that stage yet. However, people have complimented my complexion. The wonder cream is quite lovely too. It has a nice whipped buttery consistency. It locks in moisture which I’m not surprised given the hyaluronic acid, shea butter, squalane, and peptides.

This duo features Hyper Skin’s Gentle Brightening Cleansing Gel with Mandelic Acid & the Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum. Gentle Brightening Cleansing Gel:The box containing this duo smelled like the tangerine/citrus scents from the Body Shop. The culprit of this delightfully fresh smell is the brightening cleansing gel, and it struck me as a nice scent to use in the morning to help wake you up. Which is great since this cleanser is gentle enough for both AM/PM use and works well with acne-prone skin! The texture is a very thick gel that can be hard to spread and even harder to remove if you use too much product. So it’s best to follow their advice and use only a dime-sized amount for each cleanse and lather it in your palms. What’s great about that is that this cleanser will last you a long time before running out so the price point is worth it. I thought it was interesting to note that the instructions also recommend letting the cleanser sit for thirty seconds before washing off which is something I don’t see often! Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum:This Vitamin C serum is a powerful little bottle to help fade hyperpigmentation more efficiently. Texture-wise this feels almost like a mix of an oil and gel to me; it’s thick enough to not slide right off your fingers/face but when spread it it glides over the face easily in a thin layer. The serum is smooth on the face and adds a glow but it also leaves a slight tacky film (less so than some other Vitamin C serums though). As for the packaging, even though the serum looks small I think this would last at least a month. However, the price is a little much for the quantity so if you’re on a budget then a different active ingredient product may be better for you.

It is delicate so won’t remove acne scars. Leaves skin soft.The moisturizer is fine. Since it has citrus, it won’t be great for the summer and could cause issues if mixed with other products.2. What are some benefits of owning this product?Easy step process. However, the two bottles are yellow, so I’d say for colour blind people you need to be careful of which to use. Also, the 3 are not daily, like the peel is only 3-4 times a week so you can’t set the set on your counter and use it every morning or evening. You need to keep track of when you do the peel.3.

The FaceGym Face Ball is said to help relieve tension, improve muscle tone, and stimulate circulation with use. The exercises that the QR code include, or what they call “ball stretches,“ are supposed to act as a warm-up session for the face while boosting lymphatic drainage to prep the skin for a training workout followed by the application of heavier creams or serums.Honestly, I didn’t see any immediate visible changes nor did I expect to since this is a “workout.“ I did find that the Face Ball was easy to use and the instructions were easy to follow. While the Face Ball itself has a nice texture and is easy to maneuver around the face to complete the recommended exercises, I did find it a little on the larger side for my hands/face and probably could have used a slightly smaller size.Also, I didn’t notice a difference in the absorption of products such as heavier creams or serums either but it’s hard to say after a few uses because essentially this is a facial workout and it’s hard to expect immediate results from any workout in general.Overall, it’s a really interesting product/concept and I don’t really expect any visible results for a while so I will continue to use the FaceGym Face Ball and hope for any results.

I’ve never really had this problem and regular soap and deodorant have always been effective. It’s gotten so bad though that literally every new product I get in beauty boxes goes straight to my armpits. I have been using this to scrub my armpits every day for the last week and it’s been keeping my stank at bay. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I still smell like a regular person at the end of the day. Bodies produce odor and there’s nothing you can do to completely stop that. But before this scrub, I couldn’t even get the smell off at all no matter what I did. It keeps me feeling cleaner throughout the day. I think it may have to do with the enzymes breaking down the bacteria and odors.
